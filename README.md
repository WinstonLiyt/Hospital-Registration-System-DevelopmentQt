# Hospital-Registration-System-Development (Qt)

## Requirement

A hospital has **15 departments**, **each with** **3 doctors** on duty; there is **1 ultrasound room** with **3 ultrasound machines**. A number-calling system is required to manage the sequence of appointments in each department. After diagnosing patients, each department will arrange the order for ultrasound examination based on the need for ultrasound checks. Throughout the process, the system should record the patients each doctor sees and the duration of each consultation.

1.   The system should support the registration process and the doctors' consultation process.
2.   It should display the current queue status for each department and the ultrasound room.
3.   It should be able to show all patients seen by each doctor.
